#### 2. **Scikit-Learn Implementation**
- Using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
- Model training with `.fit()` method
- Predictions and parameter extraction
- Performance comparison with manual implementation

#### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Scatter plots of training data
- Regression line visualization
- Extrapolation demonstrations
- Using Matplotlib for comprehensive plotting

#### 4. **Real-World Dataset Analysis**
- **Diabetes Dataset**: Multi-feature regression analysis
- 10-feature dataset with 442 samples
- Comprehensive data exploration using Pandas

#### 5. **Advanced Techniques**

##### **Regularization Methods**
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization for feature selection
- **ElasticNet**: Combined L1 and L2 regularization
- Cross-validation for optimal hyperparameter selection

##### **Feature Engineering**
